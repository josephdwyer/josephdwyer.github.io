I'm a soon to be father and developer living in the San Francisco Bay area.

I have been doing .NET development for six years (and I am pretty good at it). Currently, I work on PlanGrid for Windows so people in the construction industry can get stuff done and get home on time.

In my spare time, I drink coffee & tea, build wooden things, and  grill. I also have an interest in finance and tax laws because I want to retire early (and this is completely feasible).
